# Next.js Build Time Expectations

## Typical Build Times

The "Creating an optimized production build..." phase duration depends on several factors:

### Small Applications (< 50 pages)
- **Build time**: 1-3 minutes
- **Optimization**: 30 seconds - 1 minute
- **Total**: 2-4 minutes

### Medium Applications (50-150 pages)
- **Build time**: 3-8 minutes
- **Optimization**: 1-3 minutes
- **Total**: 5-12 minutes

### Large Applications (150+ pages)
- **Build time**: 8-20 minutes
- **Optimization**: 3-10 minutes
- **Total**: 12-30 minutes

### Very Large Applications (300+ pages)
- **Build time**: 20-45 minutes
- **Optimization**: 10-20 minutes
- **Total**: 30-60+ minutes

## Factors Affecting Build Time

1. **Number of pages/routes**
   - More pages = longer build time
   - Each page is compiled and optimized

2. **TypeScript compilation**
   - Type checking adds time
   - Complex types slow compilation

3. **Code size**
   - More components = longer build
   - Large dependencies increase time

4. **Optimization level**
   - Image optimization
   - Code splitting
   - Tree shaking
   - Minification

5. **Server resources**
   - CPU speed
   - Available memory
   - Disk I/O speed

6. **Memory availability**
   - Low memory causes swapping
   - OOM kills restart the build

## Your Application

Based on the codebase:
- **Pages**: ~50-100+ routes (estimated)
- **Components**: 200+ TypeScript/TSX files
- **Complexity**: Medium to Large

**Expected build time**: **5-15 minutes** under normal conditions

## Current Situation

If the build is taking longer than 15-20 minutes, it's likely because:

1. **Memory exhaustion** (your current issue)
   - Build gets killed and restarts
   - Never completes
   - **Solution**: Increase memory to 2GB

2. **CPU constraints**
   - Slow CPU = slow compilation
   - Multiple builds competing

3. **Disk I/O**
   - Slow disk = slow file operations
   - Network storage can be slow

## Monitoring Build Progress

Watch for these stages:

1. **"Creating an optimized production build..."**
   - Initial compilation
   - Usually 1-5 minutes

2. **"Compiling /..."**
   - Compiling individual routes
   - Shows progress per route

3. **"Linting and checking validity of types"**
   - TypeScript type checking
   - Usually 1-3 minutes

4. **"Collecting page data"**
   - Gathering static data
   - Usually 30 seconds - 2 minutes

5. **"Generating static pages"**
   - Building static pages
   - Time depends on page count

6. **"Finalizing page optimization"**
   - Final optimizations
   - Usually 1-2 minutes

## When to Worry

- **Build takes > 30 minutes**: Likely stuck or resource-constrained
- **Build keeps restarting**: Memory issue (your case)
- **No progress for 10+ minutes**: Check logs for errors
- **Repeated failures**: Check memory/CPU limits

## After Memory Fix

With 2GB memory, your build should:
- Complete in **8-15 minutes** (first build)
- Complete in **5-10 minutes** (subsequent builds with cache)
- Show steady progress through all stages
- Finish with "✓ Compiled successfully"

## Checking Build Status

```bash
# Watch build progress
docker logs -f kiplombe_frontend

# Check if build completed
docker exec kiplombe_frontend ls -la /app/.next/standalone

# Check build time
docker logs kiplombe_frontend | grep -E "Creating|Compiled|Route" | head -20
```

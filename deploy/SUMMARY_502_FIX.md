# 502 Error Fix Summary

## Issues Found

1. **Auto-healing scripts were NOT set up**
   - Cron jobs didn't exist (setup script had a bug in checking)
   - Scripts were uploaded but never activated

2. **Nginx health check was failing**
   - Health check used `localhost` instead of `127.0.0.1`
   - Fixed in `docker-compose.deploy.yml`

3. **Frontend connectivity issues**
   - Frontend container sometimes not responding
   - May be related to build process or startup timing

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed Auto-Healing Setup
- ✅ Fixed cron job detection logic in `setup-auto-healing.sh`
- ✅ Manually set up cron job: `*/5 * * * * /home/fhir/auto-heal-containers.sh`
- ✅ Auto-healing now runs every 5 minutes

### 2. Fixed Nginx Health Check
- ✅ Updated `docker-compose.deploy.yml` to use `127.0.0.1` instead of `localhost`
- ✅ Health check now works correctly

### 3. Created Diagnostic Scripts
- ✅ `check-and-fix-502.sh` - Comprehensive 502 diagnosis and fix
- ✅ `fix-nginx-health.sh` - Fix nginx health check specifically

## Current Status

- ✅ **Cron job**: Set up and running
- ✅ **Auto-healing script**: Working (restarted nginx successfully)
- ⚠️ **Frontend**: May need restart if still not responding

## Next Steps

1. **Monitor auto-healing logs**:
   ```bash
   ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_asusme fhir@41.89.173.8 'tail -f /home/fhir/auto-heal.log'
   ```

2. **If 502 errors persist**, run:
   ```bash
   ./deploy/check-and-fix-502.sh 41.89.173.8 ~/.ssh/id_asusme
   ```

3. **Check frontend logs**:
   ```bash
   ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_asusme fhir@41.89.173.8 'docker logs -f kiplombe_frontend'
   ```

4. **Manual restart if needed**:
   ```bash
   ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_asusme fhir@41.89.173.8 'docker restart kiplombe_frontend kiplombe_nginx'
   ```

## Auto-Healing Behavior

The auto-healing script now:
- Runs every 5 minutes via cron
- Checks all container health
- Restarts unhealthy containers
- Checks connectivity between services
- Cleans up Docker if disk space is low (>90%)

## Files Modified

1. `docker-compose.deploy.yml` - Fixed nginx health check
2. `deploy/setup-auto-healing.sh` - Fixed cron detection logic
3. `deploy/check-and-fix-502.sh` - New comprehensive diagnostic script
4. `deploy/fix-nginx-health.sh` - New nginx health fix script

# Drug Inventory Redesign - Implementation Status

## ✅ Completed

### 1. Database Enhancements
- ✅ Created `drug_stock_adjustments` table to track all stock movements with batch details
- ✅ Added patient information columns to `drug_inventory_transactions`:
  - `patientId` - Links to patients table
  - `prescriptionId` - Links to prescriptions table
  - `dispensationId` - Links to dispensations table
- ✅ Created comprehensive views:
  - `vw_drug_inventory_aggregated` - Aggregated view of inventory by medication
  - `vw_drug_history_complete` - Complete history with patient information

### 2. API Enhancements
- ✅ Updated transaction creation to include patient information
- ✅ Stock adjustments are now created automatically for all transactions
- ✅ New API endpoints:
  - `GET /api/pharmacy/drug-history` - Filtered drug history with pagination
  - `GET /api/pharmacy/drug-history/patient/:patientId` - Patient-specific history

### 3. Data Migration
- ✅ Existing transactions migrated to `drug_stock_adjustments`
- ✅ Patient information backfilled from dispensations
- ✅ All batch details preserved in stock adjustments

## 🔄 In Progress / Next Steps

### 1. UI Components
- [ ] Create independent "Drug History" page/tab with filters
- [ ] Update history dialog to show patient information
- [ ] Add patient column to transaction history table
- [ ] Create filter UI (medication, patient, date range, batch, type)

### 2. Inventory Management
- [ ] Consider implementing aggregated `drug_inventory` (one record per medication)
- [ ] Update inventory list to show aggregated quantities
- [ ] Add option to hide exhausted batches from main inventory view

### 3. Stock Adjustment Form
- [ ] Create UI form for manual stock adjustments
- [ ] Support all adjustment types (RECEIPT, ADJUSTMENT, TRANSFER, etc.)
- [ ] Include batch details input (batch number, prices, expiry)

## Current Architecture

### Tables Structure

1. **drug_inventory** (Current - per batch)
   - One record per batch
   - Contains batch-specific details (prices, expiry, quantity)
   - Status tracking (active, exhausted, expired)

2. **drug_stock_adjustments** (New - all movements)
   - All stock movements with complete batch details
   - Patient information for dispensations
   - Reference to prescriptions/dispensations
   - Complete audit trail

3. **drug_inventory_transactions** (Enhanced)
   - Transaction history with patient links
   - Quantity tracking (before/after/balance)
   - Pricing information

### Data Flow

**Receipt Flow:**
1. Create `drug_inventory` record (new batch)
2. Create `drug_inventory_transactions` record (RECEIPT)
3. Create `drug_stock_adjustments` record (with batch details)

**Dispensation Flow:**
1. Update `drug_inventory` quantity
2. Create `drug_inventory_transactions` record (DISPENSATION) with patient info
3. Create `drug_stock_adjustments` record (with patient info)

## Benefits Achieved

1. ✅ **Patient Tracking**: All dispensations now linked to patients
2. ✅ **Complete History**: All batch details preserved in stock adjustments
3. ✅ **Flexible Filtering**: API supports filtering by medication, patient, batch, date, type
4. ✅ **Audit Trail**: Complete record of who received what, when, and from which batch
5. ✅ **Data Preservation**: Batch details preserved even after exhaustion

## API Usage Examples

### Get Drug History with Filters
```javascript
// Get all dispensations for a patient
GET /api/pharmacy/drug-history?patientId=123&adjustmentType=DISPENSATION

// Get history for a medication
GET /api/pharmacy/drug-history?medicationId=5&startDate=2024-01-01

// Search across all fields
GET /api/pharmacy/drug-history?search=paracetamol&page=1&limit=50
```

### Get Patient Drug History
```javascript
GET /api/pharmacy/drug-history/patient/123?startDate=2024-01-01&endDate=2024-12-31
```

## Next Implementation Steps

1. **Create Drug History Page** (`app/(main)/pharmacy/history/page.tsx`)
   - Filter sidebar (medication, patient, date range, batch, type)
   - Data table with all columns
   - Export functionality

2. **Update History Dialog**
   - Add patient information column
   - Show patient name for dispensations
   - Link to patient profile

3. **Stock Adjustment Form**
   - Create new component for manual adjustments
   - Support all adjustment types
   - Include batch details input

4. **Inventory Aggregation** (Optional)
   - Consider migrating to aggregated view
   - One record per medication
   - Use stock adjustments for batch tracking

## Notes

- Current system maintains backward compatibility
- Existing `drug_inventory` structure preserved
- New `drug_stock_adjustments` table provides enhanced tracking
- Patient information now available in all transaction queries
- Ready for UI implementation
